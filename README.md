This repository contains  solutions for quiz questions, focusing on fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, input/output, and conditional logic (`if/else`).

##  Quiz Questions & Requirements

### 1. Main Quiz #01: School Transport Service

**Objective:** Write a program to manage fees for a school transport service.
* **Input:** Read $N$ students and the monthly bus fee for each.
* **Logic:** If a student's monthly fee is less than 900, print "Concession Given".
* **Output:** Display the total of all fees collected and the total number of students who received a concession.
* **Concepts Used:** Variables, Input/Output, Loops, and `if/else` statements.

### 2. Practice Quiz Question: Juice Shop

**Objective:** Write a program to manage sales for a juice shop.
* **Input:** Read $N$ juices sold and the price of each.
* **Logic:** If the price is less than 100, tag the item as "Small Juice".
* **Output:** Sum the total revenue and count the number of "Small Juice" items.
* **Concepts Used:** Variables, Loops, and `if/else` statements.

### Prerequisites

You need a C++ compiler (like g++ or Visual Studio) to compile and run these files.

### Compilation and Execution

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd Quiz
    ```
2.  **Compile the file (e.g., for School Transport Service):**
    ```bash
    g++ schooltransportservice.cpp -o schooltransportservice
    ```
3.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./schooltransportservice
    ```
    The program will then prompt you for the required input (e.g., the number of students and their fees)
